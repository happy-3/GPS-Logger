# GPS Logger

This project records flight log data using Core Location and sensor fusion.
Each recording session saves logs in a uniquely timestamped folder inside the
app's document directory.

## Measurement Logs

When you perform a distance measurement, the logs used to generate the altitude
chart are exported automatically. A CSV file named
`MeasurementLog_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.csv` is written inside the same session folder
as the regular flight log CSVs. Each row contains the timestamp, GPS altitude,
Kalmanâ€‘fused altitude and corresponding change rates for that measurement.

These measurement logs make it easy to review altitude changes for a specific
distance measurement alongside the overall flight log.
